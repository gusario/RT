# RT
The final project of the graphic branch of ["School 21"](https://21-school.ru/) before the first internship. It is a development of the ideas of RTv1. This is a team project.

## What's new:
* A more sophisticated interface that allows you to interact with the scene.
* More primitives.
* Json parser.
* Basic .obj parser.
* The rudiments of complex objects.
* Optimized rendering and a lot of little things.
